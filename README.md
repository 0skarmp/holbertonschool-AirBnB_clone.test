# DESCRIPTION:

This project is the first step in the creation of the "Airbnb clone":
The project will include six phases. This is the first phase of the project,
which aims to create a basic clone of Airbnb. In this phase, a basic console
was created using the Cmd Python module to manage the objects of the whole
project. It implements the methods create, show, update, all, and destroy for
the existing classes and subclasses.
